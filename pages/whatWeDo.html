 <p>On the homepage, we gave an overview of what we do. For a quick refresher, there’s a section that starts small and gradually expands in size over time, taking about five minutes to reach its full length. Below that, you'll find a more detailed section with the same information, offering a deeper dive into what we do without the expanding effect.</p>

  <p>The Game Coding Club, also known as the Digital Development Club, is a self-directed community where we help you achieve your goals related to digital development. Whether you're looking to learn, create, or collaborate, we provide guidance, resources, and support to help you along the way</p>
  <p>When it comes to projects, we don’t impose any control unless the project is hosted on the official club GitHub account. If a project is on the GitHub, it becomes a shared club project, meaning all members can contribute, modify, and collaborate on it. These projects will also be open-source, allowing anyone to learn and build upon them.</p>
  <p>If you love coding, want to learn, or simply enjoy hanging out with like-minded individuals, you’re welcome to join us! To get started, just join our Discord server using the code: [ mRqCMxtjXW ].</p>
